## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We implemented posts in the front end, posts in the back end, comments in the front end, comments in the backend, forum in the front end, forum in the back end, css for landing page, About Me component, and so much more.

- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Something we worked on/faced issues with was designing our databases to interact with accordingly.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we managed to get to everything we wnated to.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes, we got a lot of resources regarding and like Trello that helped our progress be tracked and moved according to our plan.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Our surrounding listener user story is the most at risk due to it being our stretch stretch feature, but our timeline seems to account for it.
